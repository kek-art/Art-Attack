# Art and Violent Crime 

## Problem Statement 

Proponents of art claim that it has several intangible benefits for communities invest in it. They claim art has the power to “transform minds, boost civic pride, improve mental and emotional wellbeing and instill hope in all citizens.”  But do these intangible effects actually translate into quantitative measures? There is some evidence that art can help combat some of the driving forces behind violent crime. However, the bulk of research is primarily focused on “individual-level effects of arts intervention programs on high-risk or justice-involved population, with the bulk of the literature focusing on youth.”  This means that while there is some evidence that arts are associated with reductions in violent crime, there is a lack of quantitative evaluation of art and violent crime at the county level.
